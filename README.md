## 🌌 Want to look inside my brain, my thoughts, my Atma

This is a simple space to think slowly.  
I’m not using any frameworks or tools — just plain HTML and CSS — because right now, I’m learning to build things from the ground up. One file, one folder, one post at a time.

I have an itch — a quiet thread pulling me toward something bigger, better, and more human. Maybe something that still breathes, even when I no longer do.
But then I also ponder on question on am I good enough? and what is origin of that thought? Does that even matter. Soon I will reach 25. My neurons and brain structure will become more stable and I might be okay with the life that I have and I might let go of that believe and then may be on the death bed I will think and regret it. so challenge is to figure it out. what that bigger, better means? what being human means. and even If I don't do anything like that I am okay with it and in the end will not have any regret.
